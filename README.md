### Exploring Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning ML with TensorFlow
##
#### Looking at how supervised vs unsupervised models perform on binary anomaly detection for API security data. Specifically, a supervised neural network, an unsupervised multivariate Gaussian anomaly detection model, and an unsupervised k-means cluster model are explored. The focus of this project is to explore a dataset independently and apply the concepts/models that I learned in Dr. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization.
